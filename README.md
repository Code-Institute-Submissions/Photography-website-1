### Welcome to "Vision of Two wheels".
I would like to share with you my passion for photography and old-school motorcycles. 
On this website, you will get to know a bit about the culture of old-timers and witness the gorgeous looks of these incredible machines. 
This is dedicated to individuals who love vintage motorcycles and admires photography. 
You will have the opportunity to navigate through different sections.
In the section " The Biker" you will see personas who I took pictures of during road trips or events. 
Section "The Machine" you will get to admire old timers from the 30s and so on.
Section "The Culture" is about the culture of the same mind when it comes to vintage machines, pictures were taken during parties, road trips, and different events. 
So! Hope you will enjoy my very first webpage and see my passion the way I see it.
